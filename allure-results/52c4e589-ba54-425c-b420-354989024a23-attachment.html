            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;His mother had always taught him not to ever think of himself as better than others. He&#39;d tried to live by this motto. He never looked down on those who were less fortunate or who had less money than him. But the stupidity of the group of people he was talking to made him change his mind.&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;He was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate. He knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server ice-cream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time. It had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it.&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, only a few miles from her house. The car had been hastily packed and Marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets. Dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldn&#39;t leave behind. He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed. He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen.&quot;,

The warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn&#39;t and the hopes and dreams came crashing down.&quot;,

He ran through all the events that had lead to this current situation and it still didn&#39;t make sense. He wanted to spend some time to try and make sense of it all, but he had higher priorities at the moment. The first was how to get out of his current situation of being naked in a tree with snow falling all around and no way for him to get down.&quot;,

No matter how much love you give, you can always give more. It doesn&#39;t run out, so don&#39;t try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out. Give it freely and as much as you want.&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;He couldn&#39;t remember exactly where he had read it, but he was sure that he had. The fact that she didn&#39;t believe him was quite frustrating as he began to search the Internet to find the article. It wasn&#39;t as if it was something that seemed impossible. Yet she insisted on always seeing the source whenever he stated a fact.&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;He wandered down the stairs and into the basement. The damp, musty smell of un-use hung in the air. A single, small window let in a glimmer of light, but this simply made the shadows in the basement deeper. He inhaled deeply and looked around at a mess that had been accumulating for over 25 years. He was positive that this was the place he wanted to live.&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;It&#39;s an unfortunate reality that we don&#39;t teach people how to make money (beyond getting a 9 to 5 job) as part of our education system. The truth is there are a lot of different, legitimate ways to make money. That doesn&#39;t mean they are easy and that you won&#39;t have to work hard to succeed, but it does mean that if you&#39;re willing to open your mind a bit you don&#39;t have to be stuck in an office from 9 to 5 for the next fifty years o your life.&quot;,

But that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself, who, with a sudden twist, jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust.&quot;,
