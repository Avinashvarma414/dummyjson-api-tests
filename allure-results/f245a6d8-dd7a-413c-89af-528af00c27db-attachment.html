            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;This is important to remember. Love isn&#39;t like pie. You don&#39;t need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones. No matter how much love you give, you can always give more. It doesn&#39;t run out, so don&#39;t try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out. Give it freely and as much as you want.&quot;,
